**CortenaOS** is a custom Android ROM built on the Android Open Source Project (AOSP). It focuses on delivering an **exclusive UI experience**, **stable performance**, and **real power efficiency**.

## ✨ Vision

CortenaOS is not just another Android skin — it is designed to feel **exclusive and refined**,  
balancing **fluidity, consistency, and battery life** while staying true to the AOSP foundation.

Our vision is simple:

- **Exclusive design** → Custom UI components, redesigned settings, control center, and launcher.
- **Stable performance** → Prioritizing smooth frame pacing and reliable responsiveness.
- **Real power efficiency** → Battery-aware policies tuned across the kernel and framework.

## 🔑 Key Features

- 🖌 **Redesigned UI** – Clean, modern interface crafted for daily usability.
- ⚡ **Stable Performance** – Optimized scheduling and thermal profiles for consistent smoothness.
- 🔋 **Battery Efficiency** – Aggressive yet safe power-saving policies.
- 🔒 **Security First** – SELinux enforcing, with privacy-conscious defaults.
- 📲 **OTA Ready** – Incremental updates delivered seamlessly.

## 📱 Supported Devices
